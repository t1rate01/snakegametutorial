# snakegametutorial
 Began by following a tutorial, then polished further.  

 -- Tutorial finished  
 -- Added flexible out of bounds collisionchecks(not tested with different devices)  
 -- Added Mainmenu as startscreen, and a button to go back to it  
 -- Added difficulty choises and functionalities  
 -- Added a check that food cannot spawn on snake and a margin to keep food from too close to the edges  
 -- Prevented snake from making a 180 on itself, and colliding with itself causes gameover  


 Added:
 -- Locally stored highscores
